# Project Proposal

CS 6800

## Project Specification
This project will consist of a program that creates a finite state machine from a regular expression. To be more specific, it will create a DFA. The program will be handed a regular expression. It will first create an NFA- Î». Then it will convert that FSA into a DFA.

## Project Goals
The main goal of the project is to convert an NFA into a DFA. The secondary goal would be to convert a regular expression into an NFA. Lastly, the functionality to convert a DFA into a minimum state DFA will be developed.

Since regular expressions have many functionalities within them, my program will support only a subset of that functionality. These functionalities include the Kleene star, groups, concatenation, and or. One thing to note is that the syntax for the regular expression will be based on that in daily use rather than the mathematical notation. 

## Team Members
The team will consist of me and me alone.
